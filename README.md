# Playfair Cracker

This project spawned while trying to solve Stage 6 of Simon Singh's *The Code Book* cipher challenge. (Check it out! https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/)

This includes 3 command line programs
- playfair - For encrypting and decrypting text with the Playfair cipher
- ngramFrequency - For collecting and managing English n-gram frequencies
- playfairCracker - To help crack text encrypted with the Playfair cipher

These only work with English, sorry! I did consider allowing these to easily include or be rewritten for other languages, but due to the unqiue nature of this cipher, that was too difficult.


#### In progress - check back in a couple weeks for completion.
Programs are done, but not tested yet. Documentation about 50% done. 3/27/18
